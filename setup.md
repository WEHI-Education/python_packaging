title: Setup

This lesson teaches how to create and publish packages in Python. We assume a basic
understanding of Python, and assume learners are comfortable using simple commands in a
Bash shell. The lesson assumes learners are working in Linux, but we hope to update this
to include other operating systems in future. For the final lesson on publishing Python
code, it will also be helpful to understand how to use Git to manage software projects.
A lesson on Git is available with the [Software Carpentires][sc-git].

Some sections are marked 'extra', and these contain non-essential information that may
be of interest to some learners. These sections do not need to be covered in order to
understand the core content of the course.
